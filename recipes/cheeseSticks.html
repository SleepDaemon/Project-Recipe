    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You'll find the full step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when you make these fried mozzarella
        sticks:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend
            flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
        <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in
            the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with
            remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
        <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry until golden
            brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks.
        </li>
    </ol>
